                <p>Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.[1][2][3] Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).[4][5][6] Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.[7]

            Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[8] The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Humanâ€“computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.</p>

                <p>Polytechnic in Computer Science and Engineering is a 3 year program and the curriculum is spread over 6 semesters. The fundamental objective of the program is to provide the opportunity for the students to develop a firm foundation in Science, Mathematics and Design Methodology of the computer systems.  The course covers all the fundamentals and offers a holistic learning environment where students understand, learn and apply the most contemporary and essential tools and technologies required.
                    In the first year, basic engineering subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Engineering Drawing are covered.  From second year, students will focus on core subjects including data structure, programming, operating system, computer networks, web technologies, complier design, software engineering, databases and computer architecture and theoretical computer science.

         <p>Education is one of the foremost requirements for Development. Government of Telangana has taken several initiatives to provide quality Education to the youth in the State. The Government is improving the Education status to enhance the standard of living of the people and also to achieve other goals like, overcoming the problem of poverty and unemployment, social equality, equal income distribution, etc. Education contributes to the individuals wellbeing as well as the overall development. It is not only an instrument of enhancing efficiency but is also an effective tool of widening and augmenting democratic participation and upgrading the overall quality of individual and societal life. Government of Telangana Manages 26040 Schools with 107259 Teachers and 2150626 students.
            The following measures are being undertaken to bring the government closer to its goals.</p>

            <p>Childhood memories are very important in our lives. It makes us remember the best times of our lives. They shape our thinking and future. When one has good childhood memories, they grow up to be happy individuals. However, if one has traumatic childhood memories, it affects their adult life gravely.
                Thus, we see how childhood memories shape our future. They do not necessarily define us but they surely play a great role. It is not important that someone with traumatic childhood memories may turn out to be not well. People get past their traumatic experiences and grow as human beings. But, these memories play a great role in this process as well.
                Most importantly, childhood memories keep the inner child alive. No matter how old we get, there is always a child within each one of us. He/She comes out at different times.
                For instance, some may act like a child on seeing swings; the other may get excited like a child when they see ice cream. All this happens so because we have our childhood memories reminding us of the times associated with the things we get excited about. Therefore, childhood memories play a great role in our lives.
